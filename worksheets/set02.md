## Read and analyze (analytical reading)

Observe and describe. Make notes. Explore the links provided in the material. Document what you have learned. When you come to an example, make your own version and explore it deeply. “Curiosity Is the engine of achievement.” —Sir Ken Robinson

8. [JavaScript building blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks) In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code block such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.
9. [Making decisions in your code — conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals) In any programming language, code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime. In this article we'll explore how so-called conditional statements work in JavaScript.

# Exercises

1. **Fibonacci numbers** *from previous worksheet* 
    - (v.4) &mdash; Modify your console version to display the sequence on the page. Use `document.write()` method.
    - (v.5) Extend the program to capture user’s input to determine how many numbers to display. Use `document.write()` method to display the sequence underneath the input control. 
2. **Temperature conversion** 
    - (v.2) &mdash; Modify your program to display on the page.
    - (v.3) &mdash; Extend the program to capture user's input to determine what value to convert. Display on the page with two (2) decimal places.
3. **Area of a circle** 
    - (v.2) &mdash; Extend the program to get the value from the user. Display on the page.
4. **Quadratic roots** 
    - (v.2) &mdash; Extend the problem to display the results on the page in an HTML table.
5. **Prime numbers** 
    - (v.2) &mdash; Extend the program to display on the page.
    - (v.3) &mdash; Modify the program to display the numbers in an unordered list.
7. **Is it a palindrome** 
    - (v.1) &mdash; Write a function that takes one argument, a string or a number, and checks if it is a palindrome, and returns a true or false. The function needs to ignore spaces and casing.

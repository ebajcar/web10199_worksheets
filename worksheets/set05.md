### Review (or catch up) with HTML forms and styling forms (syst10049)
- [https://ebajcar.github.io/modules_syst10049/pages/ch_5_3_1.html](https://ebajcar.github.io/modules_syst10049/pages/ch_5_3_1.html) **An HTML form** is a section of a document containing normal content, markup, special elements called controls (checkboxes, radio buttons, menus, etc.), and labels on those controls. Users generally "complete" a form by modifying its controls (entering text, selecting menu items, etc.), before submitting the form to an agent for processing (e.g., to a Web server, to a mail server, etc.)

Most often, the purpose of data validation is to ensure correct input to a computer application.

6. [W3C - HTML 5.3 - Section 4.10. Forms](http://w3c.github.io/html/sec-forms.html)  &mdash; A form is a component of a Web page that has form controls, such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, range controls, or color pickers. A user can interact with such a form, providing data that can then be sent to the server for further processing (e.g., returning the results of a search or calculation). No client-side scripting is needed in many cases, though an API is available so that scripts can augment the user experience or use forms for purposes other than submitting data to a server.&hellip;

# Exercises

## Regular Expressions

### [Character classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes)
`\`, `.`, `\cX`, `\d`, `\D`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\s`, `\S`, `\t`, `\v`, `\w`, `\W`, `\0`, `\xhh`, `\uhhhh`, `\uhhhhh`, `[\b]`
```js
const chessStory = 'He played the King in a8 and she moved her Queen in c2.';
const regexpCoordinates = /\w\d/g;
console.log(chessStory.match(regexpCoordinates));
// expected output: Array [ 'a8', 'c2']

const moods = 'happy üôÇ, confused üòï, sad üò¢';
const regexpEmoticons = /[\u{1F600}-\u{1F64F}]/gu;
console.log(moods.match(regexpEmoticons));
// expected output: Array ['üôÇ', 'üòï', 'üò¢']
```
#### More Examples
- Looking for a series of digits
- Looking for a word (from the Latin alphabet) starting with A
- Looking for a word (from Unicode characters)

#### Specifications
- [https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-characterclass](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-characterclass)

### [Groups and ranges](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Groups_and_Ranges)
`(x)`, `(?:x)`, `x|y`, `[xyz]`, `[^xyz]`, `\`_Number_
```js
const aliceExcerpt = 'The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other';
const regexpWithoutE = /\b[a-df-z]+\b/ig;
console.log(aliceExcerpt.match(regexpWithoutE));
// expected output: Array ["and", "at"]

const imageDescription = 'This image has a resolution of 1440√ó900 pixels.';
const regexpSize = /([0-9]+)√ó([0-9]+)/;
const match = imageDescription.match(regexpSize);
console.log(`Width: ${match[1]} / Height: ${match[2]}.`);
// expected output: "Width: 1440 / Height: 900."
```
#### More Examples
- Counting vowels
- Using groups
- Using named groups

### [Quantifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Quantifiers)


```js
const ghostSpeak = 'booh boooooooh';
const regexpSpooky = /bo{3,}h/;
console.log(ghostSpeak.match(regexpSpooky));
// expected output: Array ["boooooooh"]

const modifiedQuote = '[He] ha[s] to go read this novel [Alice in Wonderland].';
const regexpModifications = /\[.*?\]/g;
console.log(modifiedQuote.match(regexpModifications));
// expected output: Array ["[He]", "[s]", "[Alice in Wonderland]"]

const regexpTooGreedy = /\[.*\]/g;
console.log(modifiedQuote.match(regexpTooGreedy));
// expected output: Array ["[He] ha[s] to go read this novel [Alice in Wonderland]"]
```

#### More Examples
- Repeated pattern
- Counting characters
- Optional character

# Learning objectives

> (1) Apply dynamically-typed variables with implicit type conversion… using JS.

> (2) Apply JS functions and control structures…

> (3) Design small client-side web apps that employ JS functions to respond to HTML DOM events… making changes to the HTML DOM.

> (4) Apply JavaScript's support for first class functions…

> (8) Apply best practices in internal documentation, file naming and web site structure…

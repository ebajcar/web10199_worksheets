7. [JavaScript building blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks) In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code block such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.
8. [Making decisions in your code — conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals) In any programming language, code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime. In this article we'll explore how so-called conditional statements work in JavaScript.

# Exercises

1. **Fibonacci numbers** *from previous worksheet* 
    - (v.4) &mdash; Modify your console version to display the sequence on the page. Use `document.write()` method.
    - (v.5) Extend the program to capture user’s input to determine how many numbers to display. Use `document.write()` method to display the sequence underneath the input control. 
2. **Temperature conversion** 
    - (v.2) &mdash; Modify your program to display on the page.
    - (v.3) &mdash; Extend the program to capture user's input to determine what value to convert. Display on the page with two (2) decimal places.
3. **Area of a circle** 
    - (v.2) &mdash; Extend the program to get the value from the user. Display on the page.
4. **Quadratic roots** 
    - (v.2) &mdash; Extend the problem to display the results on the page in an HTML table.
5. **Prime numbers** 
    - (v.2) &mdash; Extend the program to display on the page.
    - (v.3) &mdash; Modify the program to display the numbers in an unordered list.
7. **Is it a palindrome** 
    - (v.1) &mdash; Write a function that takes one argument, a string or a number, and checks if it is a palindrome, and returns a true or false. The function needs to ignore spaces and casing.
    - (v.2) &mdash; Create an array and populate with: 02022020, 1001, aba, "was it a car or a cat I saw" "never odd or even" "Step on no pets" "Funny enough"   "new moon", "selfless". You can add your own members. Test your function for each member. Output to console, for examples: `01011010 true` and so on.
6. **Game of Casino Craps**
	- (v.1) Write a program that lets a user to play a game of casino craps in the console.
7. **Game of Rock Paper Scissors**
	- (v.1) Write out an algorithm for the game of Rock Paper Scissors.  Assume one human players plays against the computer.
8. **Game of Tic Tac Toe**
	- (v.1) Write out an algorithm for the game of tic tac toe.  Assume two human players sit together with a sheet of paper (or single monitor/keyboard) and take turns.

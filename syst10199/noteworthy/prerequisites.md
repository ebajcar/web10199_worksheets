> Note: it is important to study for mastery of the course content, not grades. Even if you pass a course, you are still responsible to ensure that you can demonstrate your mastery for all the Learning Outcomes stated in the Course Outlines. Keeping up and asking timely questions enables the entire class to complete the required content.  Failing to keep up results in finding the material more and more difficult to understand, from course to course, because you are lacking the foundations upon which the content is build. Keep in mind that it is not only that it will be harder to catch up and deal with the more complex concepts, you are also impacting the rest of the class.

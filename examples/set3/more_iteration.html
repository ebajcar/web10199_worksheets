Description:

avaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true

// The for...of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.
// iterable object includes string and array; NOT object
/*
for (variable of iterable) {
  code block to be executed
}
*/
var astring = 'JavaScript';
var achar;

for (achar of astring) {
  console.log(achar + " ");
}



const arr = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13];
var mem, str = "";

for (mem of arr) {
  str += " " + mem;
}
console.log("2. for mem of arr ", str);


// for...in
// https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_forin.asp
// The for/in statement loops through the properties of an object.
// The block of code inside the loop will be executed ONCE FOR EACH PROPERTY.
// DO NOT USE to loop through arrays where index order is important. Use the for statement instead.

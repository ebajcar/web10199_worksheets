# Converting JS code to PHP code (functional paradigm)

The php version of tic tac toe [ttt_2020_2.php](ttt_2020_2.php) is a functional coding approach (though there are some global variables)
- using pure PHP (everything in the file is PHP code and we produce HTML with PHP echo function)
- need to use GET (or POST) method to pass data to the PHP environment for processing on EVERY CLICK (replaces the event-driven aspect of JS)
- need to use SESSIONS to keep the state of the variables from HTTP request to HTTP request (web pages are stateless)
- need to choose a different representation of the board (no access to the DOM, therefore no HTML collection of td's)

## Variables

In Javascript, we used
```js
// current player
var player = "X"; 
//array (HTML collection) of 9 objects  
var board = document.getElementsByTagName("td"); 
//all winning combinations, 3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals
var winSets = [ [0,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8], [0,3,6],[1,4,7],[2,5,8], [0,4,8],[2,4,6] ]; 
// number of available (empty) cells
var empty = 9; 
// game not in session (false if in process)
var gameover = false; 
```

In PHP, we need to keep track of the same data, using PHP, in this version, we use an associative array:
```php
$game = array(
  // current player
  "who" => 0,
  // representation of the board
  "board" => "222222222",
  // do we have a winner and who is it?
  "win" => -1,
  // character representation, symbol, of the players
  "playToken" => "XOT",
  // game over or in session
  "endGame" => -1,
  // which cell was selected (clicked) by the current player
  "clicked" => 9
);
// possible winning combinations, using the same index values as the HTML collection in JS version
$winCombo = array("012","345","678","036","147","258","840","246");

// string to construct an updated version of the board with HTML
$output = "";

// string to display whose turn it is
$outwho = "";

// string to display who won or a draw
$message = "";
```

### board
Since we do not have access to the DOM, we need to represent the structure in some other manner as we pass this value from page to page through SESSION variable.  Here we are representing the nine (9) cells by a single character for each cell, position corresponds to the index of the cell; i.e., board[0] represents the first cell (upper left corner), board[1] the second cell (first row, middle) and so on. We use three (3) values for each character: "2" represents an available cell, "1" represents a cell played by player "O", and "0" represents a cell player by player "X". **We use the representation of 0 for "X" and 1 for "O" consistently throughout the program.**

Each cell is marked up initially as:
```html
  <tr>
    <td><input class="available" type="submit" name="curCell" placeholder="-" value="0" /></td>
    <td><input class="available" type="submit" name="curCell" placeholder="-" value="1" /></td>
    <td><input class="available" type="submit" name="curCell" placeholder="-" value="2" /></td>
  </tr>
```

and changed, as the game progresses, to 
```html
  <tr>
    <td class="played">X</td>
    <td class="played">O</td>
    <td class="played">X</td>
  </tr>
```
When the player clicks on a particular cell, the HTTP request is constructed by the browser. For example, when player clicked on the first cell, the key=value pair collected from the form is `curCell=0` and the URL, using the GET method, is send as:
```
http://domain.name/path/ttt_2020_1.php?curCell=0
```

## Processing PHP code

1. Note that the first PHP statement on the page must be `session_start();`, regardless of using pure or hybrid PHP. To see the effect of not using sessions, just comment the statement out, test, and uncomment!
2. If the request is to reset the game, unset the session variables and initialize all game variables to initial values, otherwise, retrieve saved values from the session variables.
    - Use the `$_GET` variable to retrieve the key=value pairs.
    - Use the `$_SESSION` variable to retrieve any saved values.
3. Call the `play()` function.


### functions

**function play()**
is the main function that calls functions
- updateBoard()
- displayBoard()
- updateSEssion()

**function displayBoard()**
calls functions
- checkWinner()
- displayResults()

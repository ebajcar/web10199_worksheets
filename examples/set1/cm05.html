Description:
    Compare Java and HTML programming.
    Output: 
        "The sum of 5 and 7 is 12."
    Input:
        variable x to hold value 5
        variable y to hold value 7
        variable sum to hold calculated value 12
    Process: (potential algorithm)
        * declare variables
        * assignments 
			x=5
			y=7
			sum=?
        * addition 
			x+y
        * display (print) 
			strings to screen
  Constraints and assumptions:
    *values 5, 7, and 12 are fixed; 
      a single fixed string (assumption 1) 
    *values appear to be integers (assumption 2) 
    if both of these assumptions are correct,
      they become constraints
      and the solution will address only this situation.
    If either of these assumptions is incorrect, 
      how will the potential solution change?
      
Potential solutions:
  Java (solution 1: assumption 1 is true; 
      constraint is a single fixed string)
    system.out.println("The sum of 5 and 7 is 12");
    
  Java (solution 2: assumption 2 is true; 
      constraint is that all values are integers)
    int x = 5; 
    int x = 7; 
    int sum;
    sum = x + y;
    system.out.println("The sum of " + x + " and " + y + 
                       " is " + sum ".");

    Which elements are best choices depends on individual situations.

<!-- good if the values are fixed; similar to Java solution 1 -->
